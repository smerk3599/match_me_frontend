# match_me_frontend


This is a card matching game that I made with the MERN stack.

It is a two player game, as I wanted to be able to play it with my daughter. 

The cards are seeded from the back end upon dealing.  Each player then gets a chance to make a match by turning over two cards.  If the player is successful, they continue their turn, and if not, the next player goes.   The game continues until their are no more cards to turn over, and the player with the highest number of matches wins.
